This could lead to information that's no longer relevant being displayed to a user, which can sometimes have severe consequences.

Let's say you want to ensure the session lasts around 30 minutes at most.

But there's a tradeoff to consider when setting a TTL value. Suppose you were setting TTL to ensure you have the freshest version of data in the cache from the database. What if you have the value set too low on frequently-read data? In that case, the cache will be frequently refreshed by the app, leading to an increased load on the database and, thus slower performance."),(0,o.kt)("p",null,"On the other hand, if the TTL value is set too high, the data in the cache may become stale and inaccurate.

You can set the TTL value on any write operation to override that value set from the connection object. This way, every item gets its own TTL value if need be.
