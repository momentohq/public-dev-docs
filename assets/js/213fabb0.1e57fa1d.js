This could lead to information that's no longer relevant being displayed to a user, which can sometimes have severe consequences. By setting a TTL value, we can ensure that the data in the cache is deleted after a given time period has elapsed, and your app knows to refresh the item from the authoritative database."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"Storing session tokens is a good example use case scenario for TTL. Let's say you want to ensure the session lasts around 30 minutes at most. You set the TTL value on the session token item inserted into the cache for 30 minutes from session creation, and the cache deletes the session token after 30 minutes has elapsed.

But there's a tradeoff to consider when setting a TTL value. Suppose you were setting TTL to ensure you have the freshest version of data in the cache from the database. What if you have the value set too low on frequently-read data? In that case, the cache will be frequently refreshed by the app, leading to an increased load on the database and, thus slower performance."}),"\n",(0,n.jsxs)(t.p,{children:["On the other hand, if the TTL value is set too high, the data in the cache may become stale and inaccurate.

There are two places to set that value. The first one is passing in a TTL value when the app instantiates the cache connection object in an SDK call. That value is required in the instantiation and will be used in all write operations unless you override it."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"This leads me to the second place. You can set the TTL value on any write operation to override that value set from the connection object. This way, every item gets its own TTL value if need be. Be advised that by default, in Momento Cache, the maximum value you can set for a TTL is 24 hours. Even if you put a number higher than 24 hours, the cache sets the value back to 24 hours."}),"\n",(0,n.jsx)(t.p,{children:"In conclusion, cache time to live is a critical concept that helps ensure the accuracy and freshness of the data and the cache.
