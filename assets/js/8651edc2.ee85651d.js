Rather, a cache entry is a faster, cheaper, and less durable way to store a piece of data, whether it's an individual record from a different database, some aggregated or computed information from multiple records or sources, or even a resource from an external, third-party application. Using a cache helps to improve latency or reduce load on a dependency in our application. In using a cache, we're anticipating that our cache entry will be requested by another client soon."}),(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"And yet, most caches don't hold onto all of their entries forever. Partly, this is a function of data staleness. The data you have stored in a cache entry may be changed over time, in which case you want a client to retrieve something fresher than the cached entry. If you have strict requirements around data consistency, you may need to directly update or remove a cache entry whenever its underlying data changes. In other situations, you may be fine serving potentially stale data for a time, while still expiring it regularly to ensure some amount of freshness."}),(0,i.jsx)(t.p,{children:"A second consideration is simple resource constraints. Caches usually hold their data in RAM, and RAM is a scarce resource. If you never expire entries from your cache, you may find your RAM full when you try to cache new items.
