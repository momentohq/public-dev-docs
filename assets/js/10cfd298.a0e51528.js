Some example cache eviction policies include least recently used (LRU), least frequently used (LFU), and random eviction.

There are two places to set that value. Number one, when you establish the connection to the cache in your call to the SDK, you can specify that value. And number two, when you do a write operation, you can override that value on a per-object basis. If you do not set a TTL value in the write operation, the SDK uses the value from the connection object.
