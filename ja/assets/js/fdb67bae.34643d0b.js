Rather than running a service yourself, some service provider has taken over the core management responsibilities from you. If you're running a database, you won't be installing Postgres on a bare metal machine in a database. If you need a cache, you're not standing up Memcached on an EC2 instance.

Practically, this could mean you provision for specific functional capacity (such as DynamoDB's read and write capacity throughput) rather than the underlying resources (such as a database instance size with various configurations of CPU, RAM, and network I/O).

Because the service is more abstracted from underlying resources and more toward capacity, you can have a closer link between the price you pay and the value you receive. This can mean a pay-per-use billing system, such as with AWS Lambda, Amazon API Gateway, or Amazon SQS. It can also mean a system that allows for flexible scale up and scale down, such as Amazon DynamoDB or Amazon Kinesis.
