# Cheat Sheet for Swift with Momento Topics

If you need to get going quickly with Swift and Momento Topics, this page contains the basic API calls you'll need. [Check the Swift SDK examples](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-swift/tree/main/Examples) for complete, working code samples.

## Install the Momento SDK

The latest version of the Momento Swift SDK is available on GitHub: [momentohq/client-sdk-swift](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-swift).

## Get your Momento API key

You'll need a Momento API key. You can get one from the [Momento Web Console](https://console.gomomento.com/).
Once you have your token, store it in an environment variable so that the Momento client can consume it:

```
export MOMENTO_API_KEY=<your api key here>
```

**Note**: it is best practice to put the API key into something like AWS Secret Manager or GCP Secret Manager instead of an environment variable for enhanced security, but we are using one here for demo purposes.

## Set up a TopicClient
This code creates the TopicClient that you will use to interact with your pub/sub topic.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_InstantiateTopicClient'} />

## Publish a message to a topic
This is an example of publishing a message to a topic called "topic", then catching the return value to check if the publish was successful.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_TopicPublish'} />

## Subscribe to a topic
This is an example of subscribing to a topic called "topic", then catching the return value to check if it was successful. If a subscription was received, a `for try await` loop is used to asynchronously receive and print the messages that are published to this topic.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_TopicSubscribe'} />

## Running the code

You can find complete, working examples in the [Swift SDK GitHub repo examples directory](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-swift/tree/main/examples).
