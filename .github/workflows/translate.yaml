#
# NOTE: temporarily commenting out the following lines due to unknown issues with the translation tool.
#       Recent CI runs are failing with lots of "Internal Server Error" messages from Simpleen, for example:
#       https://github.com/momentohq/public-dev-docs/actions/runs/7481186195/job/20362246899?pr=610#step:6:1
#
#       There were some recent commits where the i18n files got modified manually and I'm not sure if that broke something,
#       but I'm currently unable to get simpleen to do any translation w/o Internal Server Error either when I try to run
#       it locally, or when it is run in github CI. Example commit that modified the i18n files manually:
#       https://github.com/momentohq/public-dev-docs/pull/606/files#diff-0383a939d1d10c309302e8ed36896a30028b670076d2f71c4e3a7b6f3330ade2R12
