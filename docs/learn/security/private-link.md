# AWS PrivateLink connectivity with Momento Cache and Momento Topics
Momento presents a public endpoint that is secure by default when customers connect to Momento Cache and Momento Topics. This is great for apps not deployed into a private VPC. However, some customers may need to access momento from a VPC endpoint to meet compliance requirements or cut down on bandwidth costs for network traffic. For these customers, Momento offers [AWS PrivateLink](https://aws.amazon.com/privatelink/) connectivity to customer’s hosted in Amazon Web Services (AWS) and have dedicated Momento cells.

PrivateLink connectivity provides you with the ability to create an [Amazon VPC](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/userguide/what-is-amazon-vpc.html) endpoint to Momento’s services. Once setup, all communications to and from Momento route over a private IP address space. There are two key benefits to this connectivity pattern for customers in need of this security feature:
* You don’t pay for NAT gateway instances to talk to Momento services
* Increased security posture as no traffic goes over the public internet

If this feature is something you require, please contact [Momento Support](mailto:support@momentohq.com?subject=PrivateLink).
