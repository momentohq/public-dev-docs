# *Momento Functions*

*Momento Functions* are a high-speed compute layer designed for processing massive amounts of real-time data. Whether you're aggregating IoT sensor data, handling financial transactions, or enriching event streams with AI, *Momento Functions* allow you to process, transform, and act on data instantly—without managing infrastructure.

Built for extreme scale and performance, functions offer low-latency execution and shared global memory across all running function instances. Unlike general-purpose serverless compute, they do not execute in isolation, allowing all instances of a function to share state for efficient data processing.

## Why use Momento Functions?
Most serverless platforms run functions in complete isolation, requiring external coordination to share data across executions. *Momento Functions* eliminate this bottleneck by allowing function instances to share global memory, making state management easier and improving performance at scale.

With no concurrency limits, millions of invocations per second can dynamically access batched data, fan out operations, and store insights in memory for future function calls—all without external databases or caches.

## What can you build?

### Live analytics and telemetry
Aggregate millions of IoT sensor readings or telemetry beacons per second to power dashboards and automate real-time decision-making.

### Fraud detection and financial transactions
Analyze past transactions stored in shared global memory to detect anomalies, flag suspicious activity, and improve fraud detection accuracy.

### AI-powered data processing
Enrich real-time event streams by invoking Amazon Bedrock AI models, allowing intelligent decision-making at scale.

### Media and entertainment optimization
Analyze viewer engagement data in real-time and dynamically optimize content delivery to improve user experience.
