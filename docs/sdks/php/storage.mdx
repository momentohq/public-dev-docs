# Getting Started with Momento Storage in PHP

If you need to get going quickly with PHP and Momento Storage, this page contains the basic API calls you'll need.

For more info, you can also see [the PHP SDK on GitHub](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-php).

### Prerequisites

* A Momento API Key is required. You can generate one using [the Momento console](https://console.gomomento.com/).
* Installation of PHP 8.0 or higher
* Installation of the [gRPC PHP extension](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/php/README.md).
* Installation of the [protobuf C extension](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/php/protobuf#c_implementation)
* Installation of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)  - A common library and dependency manager for PHP.

### Configure composer to get the PHP SDK

Add our repository to your `composer.json` file and our SDK as a dependency:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "momentohq/client-sdk-php": "1.11.1"
  }
}
```

Run `composer update` to install the necessary prerequisites.

## Import libraries and connect to return a StorageClient object

This code pulls in the necessary imports and instantiates the StorageClient that will be used to interact with your store.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'php'} file={'storage-cheat-sheet.php'} />

## Create a new store in Momento Storage
Use this function to create a new store in your account.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'php'} snippetId={'API_Storage_CreateStore'} />

## List the names of existing stores in your account
A simple list of the names of stores for the account.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'php'} snippetId={'API_Storage_ListStores'} />

## Write an item to a store
A simple example of doing a put operation.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'php'} snippetId={'API_Storage_Put'} />

## Read an item from a store
This is an example of a simple read operation to get an item from a store.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'php'} snippetId={'API_Storage_Get'} />

## Delete an item from a store
This is an example of a simple delete operation to remove an item from a store.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'php'} snippetId={'API_Storage_Delete'} />

## Running the code

You can find complete, working examples in the [PHP SDK GitHub repo examples directory](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-php/blob/main/examples).
