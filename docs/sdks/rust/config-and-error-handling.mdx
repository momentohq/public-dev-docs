# Asynchronous APIs, Configuration, Error Handling, and Result Types in the Momento Rust SDK

## Asynchronous APIs

All APIs in the SDK are asynchronous and return `Future`s. This means that you will need to use an
async runtime; we recommend [`tokio`](https://tokio.rs). Examples that include this dependency
and illustrate the use of `#[tokio::main]` can be found in
[the `example` directory of the github repo](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-rust/tree/main/example).

## Configuration

Pre-built configurations are provided, with settings such as timeouts and keep-alives tuned
to appropriate values for different environments. For example:

- `momento::cache::configurations::Laptop::latest()` - suitable for a development environment with lenient timeout
s
- `momento::cache::configurations::InRegion::latest()` - suitable for a production configuration with more strict
timeouts.

These configurations can be passed to the `CacheClient` and `TopicClient` builders.
For advanced use cases you can build your own configurations rather than using the pre-builts.

## Credential Providers

The `CredentialProvider` struct is used to provide the API key for the Momento service. The two
most common factory functions for creating a `CredentialProvider` are:

- `CredentialProvider::from_env_var` - reads the API key from an environment variable
- `CredentialProvider::from_string` - takes the API key as a string; can be used when retrieving the key from a se
cret manager, etc.

## Error Handling

Most APIs return a `MomentoResult`, which is just a type alias for `Result<T, MomentoError>`. You
can use a `match` statement to handle the `Result` or use the `?` operator to propagate errors.

## Enum Response Types, Type Coercion via `into` and `try_into`

Many APIs may have more than one type of response that they can return. For example, `CacheClient::get`
may return a cache hit or a cache miss. These response are represented as enums, which you can
interact with via a `match` statement, or you can use `try_into` to try to directly coerce the response
into your desired type.

All Momento cache values are stored as `vec<u8>`, but if you are using UTF-8 strings, you can use `try_into`
for these coercions as well.

Here are a few examples of how you can interact with a `CacheClient::get` response:

Using a `match`:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'rust'} snippetId={'responsetypes_get_with_pattern_match'} />

Or directly via `try_into`:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'rust'} snippetId={'responsetypes_get_with_try_into'} />

If you are using Momento collection data types, such as lists and dictionaries, we support
`into` for the main Rust types that you would expect to be able to use to represent these. For
example, for Momento dictionaries:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'rust'} snippetId={'responsetypes_dictionary_with_try_into'} />
