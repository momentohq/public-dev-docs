# Cheat Sheet for Swift with Momento Cache

If you need to get going quickly with Swift and Momento Cache, this page contains the basic API calls you'll need. [Check the Swift SDK examples](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-swift/tree/main/Examples) for complete, working code samples.

## Install the Momento SDK

The latest version of the Momento Swift SDK is available on GitHub: [momentohq/client-sdk-swift](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-swift).

## Get your Momento API key

You'll need a Momento API key. You can get one from the [Momento Web Console](https://console.gomomento.com/).
Once you have your token, store it in an environment variable so that the Momento client can consume it:

```
export MOMENTO_API_KEY=<your api key here>
```

**Note**: it is best practice to put the API key into something like AWS Secret Manager or GCP Secret Manager instead of an environment variable for enhanced security, but we are using one here for demo purposes.

## Set up a CacheClient
This code creates the CacheClient that you will use to call the other methods.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_InstantiateCacheClient'} />

## Create a new cache in Momento Cache
Use this function to create a new cache in your account.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_CreateCache'} />

## List the names of existing caches in your account
A simple list of the names of caches for the account.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_ListCaches'} />

## Delete a cache
Use this function to delete a cache from your account.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_DeleteCache'} />

## Write an item to a cache
A simple example of doing a set operation. In the CacheClient.set() call, the TTL is optional. If you did pass it in, this would override the default TTL value set with the client connection object.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_Set'} />

## Read an item from a cache
This is an example of a simple read operation to get an item from a cache.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_Get'} />

## Delete an item from a cache
This is an example of deleting an item from a cache.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'swift'} snippetId={'API_Delete'} />

## Running the code

You can find complete, working examples in the [Swift SDK GitHub repo examples directory](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-swift/tree/main/examples).
