# Using Compression in the Momento Node.js SDK

## Why Compression?

If your cache data consists of large string values, especially those that can be repetitive like JSON, enabling client-side
compression may reduce the size of the data that you are transferring to and from Momento by as much as 90%. This can
result in significant cost savings due to reduced network traffic and storage costs.

## Enabling Compression

The `get`/`set` and `getBatch`/`setBatch` cache methods in the Momento Node.js SDK support compression. To avoid requiring
additional dependencies in the main SDK, compression support is provided by installing an extension package. We provide
two different extension packages that you can choose from, both available on npmjs.com:

- [@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression) - the default, recommended compression extension, which is based on `gzip`.
- [@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression-zstd](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression-zstd) - an alternative compression extension, based on `zstd`, for advanced users who
  are willing to tackle a slightly more difficult packaging configuration in exchange for improved performance.

Because `gzip` is available in the node.js standard library, there are no additional dependencies required, so packaging
your app will be the same as any other Momento node.js app. The `zstd` extension requires an additional native dependency
that is specific to your target platform, so you will need to make sure that your builds are configured to include the
correct dependency for the target architecture.

In our testing we found that, for typical JSON data being stored in a Momento cache, the compression ratio is very similar
between the `gzip` and `zstd` compression extensions. However, for very large values (100kb or larger), `zstd` can provide
up to a 20% performance improvement in the time that it takes to compress and decompress the data.

If you're not sure which extension is right for you, we recommend starting with the default
[@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression) package. You can
switch to `zstd` later if you find that you need the additional performance.

To get started with compression, first add the compression extension package to your project:

```cli
npm install @gomomento/sdk-nodejs-compression
```

Once that is installed, you can enable compression by adding a compression strategy to the cache client configuration:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'API_ConfigurationWithCompression'} />

## Compressing your data

With the dependency installed and the client configured, you can specify `compress: true` when calling set or setBatch to compress that value:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'API_SetWithCompression'} />

## Automatic Decompression

By default, when you enable compression, the SDK also enables automatic decompression. This means that any cache value that
the SDK reads via `get` or `getBatch` will be automatically decompressed if it was compressed when it was written. Therefore,
you don't need to change any of your existing calls to `get` or `getBatch` to handle compressed data.

If you want to be able to compress data, but don't want the SDK to automatically decompress it, you can also configure that:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'API_ConfigurationWithCompressionNoAutomatic'} />

If automatic decompression is disabled, you can specify `decompress: true` when calling `get` or `getBatch` to tell the
SDK to decompress that particular value:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'API_GetExplicitDecompress'} />

Uncompressed data will be unaffected by the compression configuration.
