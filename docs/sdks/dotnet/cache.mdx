# Getting Started with Momento Cache in .NET

If you need to get going quickly with .NET and Momento Cache, this page contains the basic API calls you'll need. [Check the .NET SDK examples](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-dotnet/blob/main/examples) for complete, working examples including build configuration files.

## Install the Momento SDK

Install the client library in an existing .NET project:

```cli
dotnet add package Momento.Sdk
```

## Set up your API key

You'll need a Momento API key to authenticate with Momento.  You can get one from the [Momento Web Console](https://console.gomomento.com/caches).
Once you have your API key, store it in an environment variable so that the Momento client can consume it:

```
export MOMENTO_API_KEY=<your Momento API key here>
```

**Note**: it is best practice to put the API key into something like AWS Secret Manager or GCP Secret Manager instead of an environment variable for enhanced security, but we are using one here for demo purposes.

## Import libraries and create a CacheClient object
[This example file](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-dotnet/blob/main/examples/MomentoUsage/Program.cs) pulls in the necessary imports, reads the API key from an environment variable, and instantiates the CacheClient that is used to interact with a cache.

## Create a new cache in Momento Cache
Use this function to create a new cache in your account.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'csharp'} snippetId={'API_CreateCache'} />

## List the names of existing caches in your account
A simple list of the names of caches for the account.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'csharp'} snippetId={'API_ListCaches'} />

## Write an item to a cache
A simple example of doing a set operation. In the client.set call, the TTL is optional. If you did pass it in, this would override the default TTL value set with the client connection object.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'csharp'} snippetId={'API_Set'} />

## Read an item from a cache
This is an example of a simple read operation to get an item from a cache.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'csharp'} snippetId={'API_Get'} />

## Running the code

You can find complete, working examples in the [csharp SDK GitHub repo examples directory](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-dotnet/blob/main/examples).
