# What is Momento Leaderboards?

Momento Leaderboards is a serverless leaderboard service that supports tens of millions of items and rapid ingestion/querying/updates. While many databases approximate leaderboards via general purpose data structures like sorted set or range queries, Momento Leaderboard is a first-class, full-fledged service that you can quickly and easily integrate with your application.

:::info

Leaderboard items will have a 7-day TTL by default. For persistence (unlimited TTL), please contact our team through the [contact form](https://www.gomomento.com/contact-us), on [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3HkAKjUZGq), or by emailing support@momentohq.com.

What's the difference between Momento Leaderboards and a Sorted Set?

Momento Leaderboards has a much more efficient memory footprint, allowing us to scale to tens of millions of records, and the APIs were built with gaming use cases specifically in mind.
