## Operations

Certain cache APIs can perform multiple operations in a single request. Multi-element operations are more efficient, so the cost of these APIs is discounted at a **2:1 ratio**. This means every two elements will count as one operation towards the limiter.

As an example, an `Upsert` request adding one or two elements costs *one operation*, but with three or four elements it costs *two operations*, and so on. All the APIs listed below perform multiple operations and are subject to reduced cost. All unlisted APIs cost one operation.
