# Response objects from Momento APIs in Momento Leaderboards

Momento response objects extend from a parent class, have child types such as `Success` and `Error,` and are designed to be accessed via pattern matching. (In some languages, this concept is called "sealed classes"; in others, "algebraic data types". It is a flavor of polymorphism.) Your code checks whether the response is a `Success` or an `Error`, and then branches accordingly. Using this approach, you get a type-safe response object that you can use to get more information.

## Error

Errors that occur in calls to the Momento Leaderboards service are surfaced to developers as part of the return values of the calls rather than thrown exceptions. This helps to ensure your application doesn't crash at runtime, makes errors more visible when you're writing your code, and allows your IDE to be more helpful in ensuring you've handled the errors you care about. For more on our philosophy about this, see our blog post on why [Exceptions are bugs](https://www.gomomento.com/blog/exceptions-are-bugs), and send us any feedback you have!
