# Getting Started with Momento Storage in PHP

If you need to get going quickly with PHP and Momento Storage, this page contains the basic API calls you'll need.

For more info, you can also see [the PHP SDK on GitHub](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-php).

### Prerequisites

* A Momento API Key is required. You can generate one using [the Momento console](https://console.gomomento.com/).
* Installation of PHP 8.0 or higher
* Installation of the [gRPC PHP extension](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/master/src/php/README.md).
* Installation of the [protobuf C extension](https://developers.google.com/google-ads/api/docs/client-libs/php/protobuf#c_implementation)
* Installation of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)  - A common library and dependency manager for PHP.

### Configure composer to get the PHP SDK

Add our repository to your `composer.json` file and our SDK as a dependency:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "momentohq/client-sdk-php": "1.11.1"
  }
}
```

Run `composer update` to install the necessary prerequisites.

## Import libraries and connect to return a StorageClient object

This code pulls in the necessary imports and instantiates the StorageClient that will be used to interact with your store.
