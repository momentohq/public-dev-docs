# Getting Started with Momento Topics in .NET

If you need to get going quickly with .NET and Momento Topics, this page contains the basic API calls you'll need. [Check the .NET SDK examples](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/examples) for complete, working code samples.

## Install the Momento SDK

Install the client library in an existing .NET project:

```cli
dotnet add package Momento.Sdk
```

## Get your Momento API key

You'll need a Momento API key. You can get one from the [Momento Web Console](https://console.gomomento.com/).
Once you have your token, store it in an environment variable so that the Momento client can consume it:

```
export MOMENTO_API_KEY=<your api key here>
```

**Note**: it is best practice to put the API key into something like AWS Secret Manager or GCP Secret Manager instead of an environment variable for enhanced security, but we are using one here for demo purposes.

## Set up a TopicClient
This code creates the TopicClient that you will use to interact with your pub/sub topic.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'csharp'} snippetId={'API_InstantiateTopicClient'} />

## Publish a message to a topic
This is an example of publishing a message to a topic called "topic", then catching the return value to check if the publish was successful.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'csharp'} snippetId={'API_TopicPublish'} />

## Subscribe to a topic
This is an example of subscribing to a topic called "topic". When messages are published to this topic, the code here receives and prints them asynchronously.

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'csharp'} snippetId={'API_TopicSubscribe'} />

## Running the code

You can find complete, working examples in the [.NET SDK GitHub repo examples directory](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-dotnet/tree/main/examples).
