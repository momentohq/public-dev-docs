# How to Manage Configuration and Error Handling in the Momento Node.js SDK

The code below illustrates the simplest way to construct a `CacheClient`:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'configuration_ConstructWithNoConfig'} />

However, you may pass in a `Configuration` object to customize the behavior.

Momento provides several pre-built configurations in the `Configurations` module, such as `InRegion` (which is configured
with timeouts and connection counts that are appropriate for server-side connectivity from within the same AWS region),
and `Lambda` (which is tuned for use in AWS Lambda environments). Here is how you can specify the `Lambda` configuration:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'configuration_ConstructWithLambdaConfig'} />

:::tip
If you omit the configuration, Momento will use the `Laptop` configuration by default. This configuration has relaxed
timeouts, suitable for development or in high-latency environments. (It is not recommended for production, server-side use.)

For more information about `Configuration` objects see [SDK Configuration Objects](/cache/develop/basics/client-configuration-objects.md).

By default, `CacheClient` errors are surfaced to developers as part of the return values of the calls, as opposed to throwing
exceptions. This makes errors more visible when you're writing your code, and allows your IDE to be more helpful in ensuring
you've handled the errors you care about.

Here's an example of how to check for errors on a `get` call:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'configuration_ErrorHandlingHitMiss'} />

However, if you prefer for exceptions to be thrown, you can configure the `CacheClient` to do so:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'configuration_ConstructWithThrowOnErrorsConfig'} />

With this configuration setting, any errors that occur will result in an instance of `SdkError` being thrown. You may
catch it and use its `.errorCode()` method to determine the specific error that occurred:

<SdkExampleCodeBlock language={'javascript'} snippetId={'configuration_ErrorHandlingExceptionErrorCode'} />
