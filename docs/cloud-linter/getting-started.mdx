# Getting Started

If you haven't already, install the momento cli. Instructions for installation and usage are available in [this repo](https://github.com/momentohq/momento-cli).

Once the cli is installed, use the `cloud-linter` command to run the linter against your AWS environment. Make sure to use the AWS_PROFILE environment variable to specify the AWS account you want to use.

        <source src="/linter_preview.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</div>

This will generate a `linter_results.json.gz` file in the current directory.

You can then use the [console](https://console.gomomento.com/cloud-linter) to upload these results to Momento.
