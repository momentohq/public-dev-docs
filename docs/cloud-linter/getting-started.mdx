# Getting Started
Run the Cloud Linter and obtain automated analysis results in six easy steps!

1. Install the [Momento CLI](https://github.com/momentohq/momento-cli#installation). _Note: You do not need a Momento auth token to run the cloud linter command._
1. Configure [AWS credentials](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-files.html) in your terminal.
1. Run the command `momento preview cloud-linter`.
1. [optional] Inspect raw output in `linter_results.json.gz`, located in the current working directory.
1. Upload `linter_results.json.gz` in the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com/cloud-linter).
1. Automated analysis results will then become available after a short period.
