# Service Limits for Momento Vector Index

Momento Vector Index seeks to protect itself and their customers when it comes to service resources. To do this, every account and index have service limits, or what we call "guardrails" (like a curvy mountain road) to help keep operations running how they should and as smoothly as possible. This page outlines the default service limits:

| Momento Vector Index limits | Value |
|-----------------------------|-------|
| Total Indexes               | 5     |
| Vector Max Dimensions       | 2500  |

## Soft limits and support

The limits on this page are soft limits that can be altered unless specifically denoted. If you need limits adjusted, please reach out to [Momento Support](mailto:support@momentohq.com). Please include your login email, the name of the index(es) to be altered, the cloud+region the cache is located in (e.g. AWS us-west-2), and which limits from the list you’d like increased.
