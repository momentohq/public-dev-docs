# Response objects from Momento APIs in Momento Topics

These are the baseline responses for all commands. Some commands will add more data and functionality.

Commands fall *generally* into two categories. Those which respond with: 
1. **Success or Error** - An example is a Set operation. Either the item was successfully written to the cache or it errored.
2. **Hit, Miss, or Error** - An example is a Get operation. If the requested item is in the cache, you have a cache Hit. If it is not in the cache, you get a cache Miss. If there is some sort of error, you get an Error.

## Error

Returned in lieu of an exception.

### Constructor

- innerException: Exception - the exception which caused the error

### Methods

- message(): String - a human readable error message
- innerException(): Exception - the original exception.
- errorCode(): MomentoErrorCode - Momentoâ€™s own category of errors such as InvalidArgument or BadRequest. See [Standards And Practices - Error Handling](https://github.com/momentohq/standards-and-practices/blob/main/docs/client-specifications/error-handling.md)
- toString(): String - alias for message()

## Success

The command was successful.

## Hit

The key or field exists in the cache. Usually extended to return a value.

## Miss

The key or field does not exist in the cache.

## Set

For TTL commands, the update was applied successfully.

## NotSet

For TTL commands, the update was not applied and no change was made to the existing TTL.

## Stored

For setIfNotExists commands, the key did not exist and the value was set.

## NotStored

For setIfNotExists commands, the key existed and no value was set.
