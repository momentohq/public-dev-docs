# Use Momento Cache and Topics to build instant messaging

Instant messaging is a must-have feature in many applications. Communicating seamlessly in one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many conversations is often thought of as a necessary component of an application. With Momento Cache and Topics, you can build instant messaging into your application without any backend infrastructure. Using the [Momento web SDK](../../sdks/web), you can access your cache data and publish and subscribe to messages directly in your browser.

## Architecture

Building instant messaging on Momento can be done entirely client-side, meaning in your user interface. Browsers, iPhone apps, and Android apps, all have the capability to access server-side resources in Momento directly.

In the diagram above, messages are being loaded from a [sorted set](../../cache/develop/basics/datatypes#sorted-sets) when a new user joins the chat. Users subscribe to a chatroom-specific topic to recieve messages in real-time while they are active in the chat. As messages are sent, they are added directly to the sorted set by the sender.

## Components

Instant messaging is separated into two parts:

* Message storage
* Delivery

These core components allow users to join your chat at any time and view the message history and enable them to receive new messages in real time.

### Message storage

Most instant messaging platforms store messages to allow users to view the conversation history if messages were sent prior to their arrival. Part of the startup tasks when entering a chat room is loading said history and displaying it on screen. This can easily be done with Momento in two ways: with a **sorted set** or a **list** cache item. Naturally, each comes with their own tradeoffs.

#### Sorted sets

Typically used for things like [leaderboards](https://www.gomomento.com/blog/build-on-momento-tips-and-tricks-for-a-lightning-fast-game-leaderboard), a sorted set is a collection data type that stores multiple value/score elements. In each element, the value is a `string` and the score is an `integer`. Specifically with instant messaging, you can store the time the message was sent as the score and a stringified JSON object as the value. Storing the message timestamp as the score will automatically allow you to sort messages by time since sorted sets do that by default.

*Note - to store the time as the score, you must get an integer representation of the time. Store either ticks or time in milliseconds since the Unix epoch.*

Sorted sets have a [rich set of features](../../cache/develop/api-reference/sorted-set-collections) that allow you to slice and dice messages in many different ways. Consider the following use cases:

* Paging messages N at a time
* Retrieving messages in a certain time frame
* Displaying messages in reverse order
* Getting all messages ever sent

Based on the parameters you use in your fetch command, you can easily satisfy any of the use cases above.

A significant point to remember - **messages must be unique in sorted sets**! This means when saving the message to the sorted set, you should include some sort of message identifier in your JSON
