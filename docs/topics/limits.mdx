## Operations

Each message published to Momento Topics counts as a single operation. Every message delivered counts as an additional operation. A topic with 9 subscribers would result in 10 operations for every message published: one for the publish and one for each subscription.

Messages are billed in 1 KB chunks. A .5 KB published message will be charged 1 operation. However, a 1.4 KB message will be charged 2 operations.

## Examples

**Message broadcast**

A .1 KB message is published to a topic that has 9 subscribers.

> *1 message published + 9 subscribers = 10 operations*

**Large direct message**

A 4 KB message is published to a topic that has a single subscriber.

> *(4 KB / 1 KB chunk) x 1 subscriber = 4 operations*
