# Webhook API reference

Webhooks provide an additional way to consume messages on a topic. When a webhook is created, it gets attached to a
topic. When messages are published to this topic, an outbound http call gets POSTed to the webhook callback url. The
endpoint that is associated with the webhook must be publicly accessible for Momento to be able to POST requests. To
confirm receipt, your api should respond with an empty HTTP 2xx response to the original request. If confirmation is not
received within _5 seconds_, we drop the message and mark it as timed out.

:::note
All messages that are sent to the webhook are still available to be received with a subscription to the topic.

## Put Webhook API

Generates a new webhook with the provided webhook.

| Name    | Type                       | Description                       |
|---------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| webhook | [Webhook](#webhook-object) | The webhook object to be created. |

<details>
  <summary>Method response object</summary>

* Success
    - `secretString`: string - the signing secret for the webhook
* Error

See [response objects](/topics/api-reference/response-objects) for specific
information.

</details>

:::note

Webhooks are essential for real-time updates and notifications. Make sure to securely store the `secretString` provided
upon success, as it is required for validating incoming webhook requests.

:::

### Example

<SdkExampleTabs snippetId={'API_PutWebhook'} />

## List Webhook API

Retrieves a list of webhooks for a specific cache.

| Name  | Type   | Description                                 |
|-------|--------|---------------------------------------------|
| cache | string | The name of the cache to list webhooks for. |

<details>
  <summary>Method response object</summary>

* Success
    - `webhooks`: array of [Webhook](#webhook-object) - the list of webhooks for the specified cache.
* Error

See [response objects](/topics/api-reference/response-objects) for specific
information.

</details>

:::note

The List Webhook API can be called as frequently as needed to retrieve the latest list of webhooks. However, consider
caching the results to reduce unnecessary API calls and improve performance.

:::

### Example

<SdkExampleTabs snippetId={'API_ListWebhooks'} />

## Delete Webhook API

Deletes a webhook with the specified identifier.

| Name | Type                           | Description                                         |
|------|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| id   | [WebhookId](#webhookid-object) | The unique identifier of the webhook to be deleted. |

<details>
  <summary>Method response object</summary>

* Success
    - No additional data on success.
* Error

See [response objects](/topics/api-reference/response-objects) for specific
information.

</details>

:::note

When a webhook is deleted, it will no longer be active, and incoming requests to the deleted webhook will be ignored.

:::

### Example

<SdkExampleTabs snippetId={'API_DeleteWebhook'} />

## Get Webhook Secret API

Retrieves the secret string associated with a specific webhook.

| Name | Type                           | Description                                                      |
|------|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------|
| id   | [WebhookId](#webhookid-object) | The unique identifier of the webhook to retrieve the secret for. |

<details>
  <summary>Method response object</summary>

* Success
    - `secret`: string - the signing secret for the webhook.
    - `webhookName`: string - the name of the webhook.
    - `cacheName`: string - the name of the cache associated with the webhook.
* Error

See [response objects](/topics/api-reference/response-objects) for specific
information.

</details>

:::note

The signing secret is essential for validating incoming webhook requests. Ensure to securely store and manage the
retrieved secret.

:::

### Example

<SdkExampleTabs snippetId={'API_GetWebhookSecret'} />

## Rotate Webhook Secret API

Rotates the signing secret used for the webhook. Once the secret is rotated, all new POST requests sent to the webhook
endpoint will have a 'momento-signature' header signed with the new secret.

| Name | Type                           | Description                                                    |
|------|--------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
| id   | [WebhookId](#webhookid-object) | The unique identifier of the webhook to rotate the secret for. |

<details>
  <summary>Method response object</summary>

* Success
    - `secret`: string - the new signing secret for the webhook.
    - `webhookName`: string - the name of the webhook.
    - `cacheName`: string - the name of the cache associated with the webhook.
* Error

See [response objects](/topics/api-reference/response-objects) for specific
information.

</details>

:::note

Secret rotation cannot be reverted, it is important to update all webhooks that are validating requests against a
previous secret.

:::

### Example

<SdkExampleTabs snippetId={'API_RotateWebhookSecret'} />

## FAQ

<details>
    <summary>How do I validate incoming webhook requests?</summary>

    Check out our [webhook security page](/topics/webhooks/security) on validating inbound webhook requests.

<details>
    <summary>What is the structure of the POST body?</summary>

    ```typescript
    {
        cache: string;
        topic: string;
        event_timestamp: number;
        publish_timestamp: number;
        topic_sequence_number: number;
        token_id: string; // is an empty string if the message was published with an api key that does not contain a token_id
        text: string; // this is the message that was published
    }
    ```
</details>

<details>
    <summary>What should I do if the webhook subscription fails?</summary>

    Ensure that your webhook url is public and valid. Common issues include wrong cache or topic names, or issues with the provided `postUrl`.
