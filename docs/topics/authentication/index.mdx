Momento supports two credential types for Topics:

- **API keys** (long-lived): one key works across all regions, and you must configure the regional endpoint (cell URL). See the [API keys page](./api-keys.md) and the [regions page](/platform/regions) for endpoints.
- **Session tokens** (short-lived): scoped credentials for data-plane access, created by the Auth client. See [tokens](./tokens/index.md).

If you supply an API key without a regional endpoint, the SDK will fail with the error `Missing required property: endpoint`.
