# Service Limits for Momento Cache

Momento Cache and Momento Topics seek to protect themselves and their customers when it comes to service resources. To do this, every account, cache, and topic has service limits, or what we call "guardrails" (like a curvy mountain road) to help keep operations running how they should and as smoothly as possible. This page outlines the default service limits:

| Momento Cache limits                                                                                               | Value          |

| API rate per customer (control plane)                                                                              | 5 requests/s   |

## Soft limits and support

The limits on this page are soft limits that can be altered unless specifically denoted. If you need limits adjusted, please reach out to [Momento Support](mailto:support@momentohq.com). Please include your login email, the name of the cache(s) to be altered, the cloud+region the cache is located in (e.g. AWS eu-west-1), and which limits from the list youâ€™d like increased.
