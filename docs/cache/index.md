# What is Momento Cache?

Momento Cache is the world's first truly serverless caching service. It provides instant elasticity, scale-to-zero capability, and blazing-fast performance. Gone are the days where you need to choose, manage, and provision capacity. With Momento Cache, you grab the SDK, you get an end point, input a few lines into your code, and you're off and running.
