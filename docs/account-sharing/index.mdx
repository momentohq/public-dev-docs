# What is Account Sharing?
Momento's account sharing feature enables you to collaborate and manage access to your resources with ease. By sharing your account, you can grant other users access to your topics, caches, and other resources. You can also control the level of access each user has by assigning them roles.

## Using Roles to Control Access
The resources an account owner may share include **account** resources (e.g., account membership management and role assignment, billing and payment), **auth** resources (e.g., generating API keys and access tokens), and **data** resources (e.g., creating/deleting caches, manipulating cache data, publishing and subscribing to topics).

You can control the level of access to these categories of resources for each account member you invite using the following roles:

- **Owner**: an owner has full access to view and modify all resources.
- **Operator**: an operator has full access to view and modify all auth and data resources but has read-only access to account resources.
- **Viewer**: a viewer has read-only access to all resources.

## **How to Use Account Sharing as an Owner**

Users with the **Owner** role enjoy full access to all of the resources in the account. These are the only users able to modify account resources-- only an **Owner** can invite other users to join an account, change other users' roles, and remove users from the account.

### **Invite a User**
    - Log in to the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com).

## **How to Use Account Sharing as an Account Member**

After being invited to join an account, you can accept the invitation and switch between your accounts in the Momento Console. You can also leave an account if you no longer need access to it.

### **Accept an Invitation**
    - When a Momento account owner invites you to join an account, you will receive an email notification.
    - Click on the **Join Account** button in the email to navigate to the Momento console.
    - Log in to the console using the email address that received the invitation.
    - After logging in, you will be presented with a modal dialog displaying a list of accounts you have been invited to.

    - Follow the link to the invitations page in the dialog or visit it later by clicking on your account info dropdown and selecting **Manage User**.

        <img src="/img/account-sharing/account-menu-manage-user.png"/>

    - Click on the **Pending Invitations** tab to view all of your outstanding invitations to accounts. You can use the **Accept** button to join an account or the **Decline** button to decline and remove the invitation.

### **Switch Accounts**

    - Log in to the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com).
    - In the upper-right corner, click on your account info dropdown and select **Switch Account**.

### **Leave an Account**

    - If you no longer need access to an acount, you can leave it.
    - Log in to the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com).
    - In the upper-right corner, click on your account info dropdown and select **Manage Account**.

        <img src="/img/account-sharing/manage-account.png" width="60%"/>

    - Click on the **Account Members** tab to view all members of the account.
    - Find your user entry and click on the **Leave** button.

        <img src="/img/account-sharing/leave-account.png" width="90%"/>

    - **Note**: users with the **Owner** role may not leave an account. If you are an account owner and wish to leave the account, you must have another **Owner** remove you or change your role so you can leave the account.

## **Roles and the Console Interface**

Depending on your role in an account, different pages and user interface elements may be inaccessible to you. For example, because only users with the **Owner** role are allowed to access account resources, the buttons and links that modify account data on the **Manage Account** page will be disabled for users with the **Operator** or **Viewer** roles. User interface elements highlighted in the image below are disabled for non-**Owner** users.

    <img src="/img/account-sharing/disabled-actions.png" width="90%"/>

Hovering over any of the highlighted elements on that page will display a tooltip explaining that the element is disabled due to insufficient permissions.

    <img src="/img/account-sharing/unauthorized-tooltip.png" width="60%"/>

Users with the **Viewer** role can view account, auth, and data resources but can not modify them. These users will encounter additional disabled elements throughout the console interface, for example the **Create Cache** button on the **Caches** page. Other console pages, such as the one for generating API keys and tokens, are inaccessible to **Viewer** users. Links to these pages are styled to signify that they are not clickable.

## Important Notes
- **Member Limit**: You can have up to 10 members in your account. If you reach this limit, you will need to remove an existing user before adding a new one, or you can also request a higher limit by contacting Momento at support@momentohq.com.
- **Removing Owners**: Any **Owner** can remove any non-**Owner** account member. However, users with the **Owner** role cannot be removed from an account. To remove an account **Owner**, another **Owner** must first change their role.
