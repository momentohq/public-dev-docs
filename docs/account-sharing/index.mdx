# What is Account Sharing?
Momento's Account Sharing feature enables you to collaborate and manage your resources with ease. By sharing your account, you can grant other users access to your topics, caches, and other resources.

## How to Use Account Sharing
To get started with Account Sharing, follow these steps:

### **Add an Operator**
    - Log in to the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com).
    - In the upper-right corner, click on your account info dropdown and select **Manage Account**.

    - Enter the email address of the user you wish to add. Please ensure that the user has an existing Momento account, meaning they must have signed into the Momento console at least once using that email address.

## Important Notes
- **Existing Momento Account**: You can only add operators who have an existing Momento account and have signed into the Momento console at least once using the email address you are adding.
- **Operator Limit**: You can add up to 3 operators to your account. If you reach this limit, you will need to remove an existing operator before adding a new one, or you can also request a higher limit by contacting Momento at support@momentohq.com.
- **Full Access**: Operators have full access to the account's resources, including topics, caches, and other resources. They can perform actions like creating, updating, and deleting resources.
- **Removing Operators**: Any operator can remove other operators from the account. However, the account owner cannot be removed. If you are not the account owner, you can remove yourself from the account.
- **Adding Operators**: Any operator can add other operators to the account. To add an operator to your account, you need to know the email address associated with the user's Momento account.
- **Adding Another Owner**: To add another owner to your account, you need to contact Momento at support@momentohq.com.
