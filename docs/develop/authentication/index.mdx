You've decided to try out Momento, yeehaw! Let's talk about how you're going to make your first call and subsequently allow your app users to make calls.

We have a bunch of different ways you can interact with our services:

* In your browser via the [Momento Console](https://console.gomomento.com)
* Long-term stored usage with [API keys](/develop/authentication/api-keys.md)
* Short-term and limited scope with [tokens](/develop/authentication/tokens.md)

Each one of these methods comes with their own range of use cases and varying implementations. Based on the type of application you're building, you might choose to issue a bunch of short-lived, limited scope tokens to your users. If that's the case, then check out our page on [tokens](/develop/authentication/tokens.md). Maybe you're interested in creating a key and forgetting about it for a year. Hop over to our [API keys](/develop/authentication/api-keys.md) page.

Need help deciding which one is for you? We got you ðŸ‘‡
