# SDK Error Handling / Production Readiness

<img src="/img/error-handling.jpg" width="90%" alt="a technical illustration of Momento client configuration objects." />

Each of our SDKs has its own page in this documentation; you can navigate to them by clicking `Develop`->`SDKs` in the left nav. On each of these pages, you'll find a link for "Taking your code to prod" that provides best practices for production-ready code in that language.

Here are some general notes on error handling in Momento that apply to all SDKs.

Errors which occur in calls to `CacheClient` methods (e.g. Get, Set, Increment) are surfaced to developers as part of the return values of the calls, as opposed to throwing exceptions. This makes errors more visible when you're writing your code, and allows your IDE to be more helpful in ensuring you've handled the errors you care about. For more on our philosophy about this, see our blog post on why [Exceptions are bugs](https://www.gomomento.com/blog/exceptions-are-bugs), and send us any feedback you have!

This also helps to ensure your application doesn't crash at runtime. Momento is a cache, so applications usually have an authoritative data source they retrieve data from if the cache is unavailable. Therefore, Momento SDKs are designed to avoid throwing exceptions so your app won't crash if you forget to add a try/catch block.

Instead, Momento response objects extend from a parent class, have child types such as `Hit,` `Miss,` and `Error,` and are designed to be accessed via pattern matching. (In some languages, this concept is called "sealed classes"; in others, "algebraic data types". It is a flavor of polymorphism.) Your code checks whether the response is a `Hit,` a `Miss,` or an `Error`, and then branches accordingly. Using this approach, you get a type-safe response object in the case of a cache hit, with `value` properties that you can be assured at compile-time are not `null.` If the cache read results in a `Miss` or an `Error,` you'll also get a type-safe object that you can use to get more information about what happened (with properties such as `errorCode` that aren't present on a `Hit` object).

Here's an example of how to do the pattern matching on a `Hit`/`Miss`/`Error` response:

<SdkExampleTabs snippetId={'API_ErrorHandlingHitMiss'} />

Some APIs, such as write APIs (e.g. Set, Delete) only have `Success` and `Error` responses (as opposed to `Hit`/`Miss`). Here's an example of handling one of these responses:

<SdkExampleTabs snippetId={'API_ErrorHandlingSuccess'} />

In all cases, your IDE will be able to give you hints as to which types of responses are available for a given API, and what properties/methods are available on each of the response types.
