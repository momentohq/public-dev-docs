# Set up Laravel + Momento Cache

Laravel is a very popular development framework for PHP. Laravel is known for its elegant syntax, extensive features, and robust ecosystem to get work done quickly and efficiently.

Momento Cacheâ€™s flexible structure and serverless nature makes it a great choice for using with Laravel for simple caching or pub/sub workflows.

In this guide, we install and configure Laravel and Momento cache to build web apps and APIs.

See the [Momento Laravel cache repository](https://github.com/momentohq/laravel-cache) for more info.

## Setting up your Laravel project

### Prerequisites
* A Momento auth token is required. You can generate one using [the Momento CLI](https://github.com/momentohq/momento-cli).
* Installation of PHP 8.0 or higher
* Installation of Laravel 9.x or higher
* Installation of the [gRPC PHP extension](https://github.com/grpc/grpc/blob/v1.46.3/src/php/README.md).
* Installation of [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md)  - A common library and dependency manager for PHP.


### Configure the Laravel + Momento package

Add our repository to your `composer.json` file and our SDK as a dependency:

```json
{
  "require": {
    "momentohq/laravel-cache": "1.0.1"
  }
}
```

Run `composer update` to install the necessary prerequisites.

Then, add `MomentoServiceProvider` to your `config/app.php`:

```php
'providers' => [
    // ...
    Momento\Cache\MomentoServiceProvider::class
];
```

Finally, add the required config to your `config/cache.php`:

```php
'default' => env('CACHE_DRIVER', 'momento'),

'stores' => [
        'momento' => [
            'driver' => 'momento',
            'cache_name' => env('MOMENTO_CACHE_NAME'),
            'default_ttl' => 60,
        ],
],
```

Run `composer update` again to install the necessary prerequisites.

### Tag Support

Cache tags work the same way as explained in the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/9.x/cache#cache-tags).

:::info

If a tag may contain more than 4MB worth of keys, tagging may not work as intended.

:::

## Limits

The following Laravel cache operations are currently not supported.
* many
* putMany
* decrement
* forever
* flush

If you need these operations, please reach out to us, and we will work to prioritize adding them. You can file a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/momentohq/laravel-cache/issues), e-mail us at support@momentohq.com, or join our [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/3HkAKjUZGq).
