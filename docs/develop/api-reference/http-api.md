# HTTP API for caching and edge compute services

<img src="/img/http-api.jpg" width="90%" alt="a picture of abstract shapes as building and nodes of data connecting them at high speed" />

Momento provides a HTTP API interface for your applications that can’t use our [SDKs](/develop). For example, when deploying to edge compute services like [Cloudflare Workers](https://workers.cloudflare.com/), [Fastly Compute@Edge](https://www.fastly.com/products/edge-compute), etm. this API is for you. Be aware that most other applications should likely use [Momento’s SDK clients](/develop).

Queries are executed by sending HTTP requests to the `https://<environment>/cache/{yourCacheName}` endpoint.

:::note

This documentation does not describe how to implement HTTP request syntax as that is different and unique to each language you might use.

:::

## Authentication

For each connection, you will need a Momento auth token generated via the [Momento console](https://console.gomomento.com/tokens) or a [token "vending machine" microservice you host](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-javascript/tree/main/examples/nodejs/token-vending-machine). Momento auth tokens control access to the Momento services and can be set to expire and grant/restrict access to specific resources. 

## Access

For access to the HTTP API, use one of the following endpoints in the region your caches are in and you have a Momento auth token for.

|   | AWS Region     | Endpoints                                            |
|---|----------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| 1 | us-west-2      | api.cache.cell-4-us-west-2-1.prod.a.momentohq.com    |
| 2 | us-east-1      | api.cache.cell-us-east-1-1.prod.a.momentohq.com      |

If you do not see a Region you require, let’s discuss. Please contact [Support](mailto:support@momentohq.com).
