# Using the Momento Topics (pub/sub) API with Momento Cache
Momento Topics is a messaging pattern that allows for real-time communication between parts of a distributed application. It enables you to publish (produce) values to a topic, as well as subscribe (consume) from a topic. This page details the Momento API methods for interacting with Momento Topics.

For in-depth information, see [Momento Topics](./../../introduction/momento-topics.md).

## Topics methods

### Subscribe
This method subscribes to a topic to receive new values with a stateful connection.

| Name            | Type            | Description                                   |
| --------------- | --------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| cacheName       | String          | Name of the cache where the topic exists.     |
| topicName       | String          | Name of the topic to subscribe to.            |


<details>
  <summary>Method response object</summary>

* Success - Returns a subscription object.
* Error

See [response objects](./response-objects.md) for specific information.

With the returned subscription object, once put in a for loop, your code will receive an event when a new value is published to the Topic.

## TopicClient

Instead of the CacheClient, as used in most Momento Cache API calls, for Topics you use a TopicClient object.

## Example apps using Momento Topics APIs

A growing list of example apps using the Momento Topics.

- [A serverless item publishing microservice](https://github.com/momentohq/client-sdk-javascript/tree/main/examples/nodejs/lambda-examples/topics-microservice) This microservice is written in TypeScript and runs on AWS using API Gateway, a Lambda function, and Momento Topics. It can be used by any of your other services (with the correct security on API Gateway) to publish messages to various topics that are then subscribed to by other applications. You pass into this API a `topicName` and `topicValue` and this service publishes the value to that topic.
