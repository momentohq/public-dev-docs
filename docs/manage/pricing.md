Serverless is about simplicity in every dimension, including pricing! Momento Serverless Cache costs $0.15/GB transferred. That's it!

Momento Serverless Cache has no hidden charges. You don’t have to pay for storage, replication, or instances. We literally only charge you for data transferred in/out of Momento Serverless Cache. Everything else is included. Sign up with confidence and create something wonderful.

We’ve included some sample pricing exercises below to help you estimate. If you need further assistance (or just can’t believe it), drop a message in our [Discord](https://discord.gg/Z7FSXB89), and we’ll get it sorted out. Take the Momento Serverless Cache challenge: see how much you can save!

### Examples:

##### You process a total of 1 million read/write requests per day with average object sizes of 4KB. Momento would cost you:

`1 million requests / day * 30.5 days/month * 4KB/request * $.15/GB` = **$18.3 /month**

_See the calculation in [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=1+million%2F+day+*+4KB+*+%24.15%2FGB+to+%24%2Fmonth) for more detail._

##### You process an average load of 5K RPS with 1KB objects. Momento would cost you:

`5K requests/second * 86400 seconds/day * 30.5 days/month * 1KB/request` = **$1976/month**

_See the calculation in [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=5000%2Fsecond+*+1KB++*+%24.15%2FGB+to+%24%2Fmonth) for more detail._

##### You have a 20 RPS Lambda that caches 1KB objects. Momento would cost you:

`20 requests/second * 86400 seconds/day * 30.5 days/month * 1KB` = **$.38/month**

_Note: Without the free tier, this workflow would cost $7.88/month_

_See the calculation in [Wolfram Alpha](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input?i=%28%2820+requests%2Fsecond+*+1KB%2Frequest%29+-+50GB+%2Fmonth%29+*+%24.15%2FGB+to+%24%2Fmonth) for more detail._

<summary>Can I run a production app for free on Momento Serverless Cache?</summary>
Absolutely! Our free tier and low usage tiers are as fast, as available, and as secure as our at scale service. You get all our availability features like multi-AZ replication, hot key protection, and automatic scaling to handle bursts. You even get all our security features for free (end-to-end encryption, per request authentication, TLS).

We frequently find customers provisioning an entire cluster to handle low-RPS workflows. If you want them to be HA, you need multiple nodes. If you believe in CICD, you likely have a similarly sized cluster in staging—and maybe even in dev. That adds up! Turn off those machines—and save the environment. Go Momento!

  <summary>Can I run a production app for $1.50/month on Momento Serverless Cache?</summary>
Absolutely! If you are transferring 60 GB of data in/out of Momento Serverless Cache each month, you get the first 50GB free each month and pay $0.15/GB for the remaining 10GB each month. Access enterprise-grade availability, security, and performance at any scale with Momento.


As crazy as it sounds, we are not the first to do this. You can experience this with other serverless services like Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and more—we are just bringing serverless to caching!
