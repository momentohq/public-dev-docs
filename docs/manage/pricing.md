<summary>Can I see a few pricing examples of using Momento Cache Cache or Topics to help estimate my costs?</summary>
Yes. Your best source is <a href="https://www.gomomento.com/blog/complicated-pricing-is-not-serverless">this Momento blog post</a>.

<summary>Can I run a production app for free on Momento Cache and Topics?</summary>
Absolutely! Our free tier and low usage tiers are just billing. It is the same exact service and features whether you use 40GB/month or 40TB/month. You get all our availability features like multi-AZ replication, hot key protection, and automatic scaling to handle bursts. In the free tier, you even get all our security features for free (end-to-end encryption, per request authentication, TLS).

We frequently find customers provisioning an entire cluster to handle low-RPS workflows. If you want them to be HA, you need multiple nodes. If you believe in CICD, you likely have a similarly sized cluster in staging—and maybe even in dev. That adds up! Turn off those machines—and save the environment. Go Momento!

  <summary>Can I run a production app for $5.00/month on Momento Cache?</summary>
Absolutely! If you are transferring 60 GB of data in/out of Momento Cache each month, you get the first 50GB free each month and pay $0.50/GB for the remaining 10GB each month. Access enterprise-grade availability, security, and performance at any scale with Momento.


As crazy as it sounds, we are not the first to do this. You can experience this with other serverless services like Amazon DynamoDB, Amazon S3, and more—we are just bringing serverless to caching!

  <summary>Can I really store as much data in my cache(s) as I want?</summary>
Heck yeah! You are billed for the inbound and outbound transfer of data, not for the volume of data in your cache.

<details>
  <summary>Will it scale?</summary>
Hell yes! Momento Cache is the best way to future-proof your caching story. You can add Momento Cache *extremely* quickly—and it just fades into the background whether you are doing 1 RPS or 1 million RPS. You just pay for what you use—so you get a scalable cache without spending a lot of cash.

<details>
  <summary>Will it blend?</summary>
We do not recommend putting Momento Cache in a blender as it may void the warranty of your blender, but Momento Cache  is robust with enterprise grade security and availability. Momento Cache does blend seamlessly with your current cloud setup, whether you're on AWS, GCP, Azure, or multi-cloud!
