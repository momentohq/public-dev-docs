# Service Limits for Momento Cache and Momento Topics

Momento Cache and Momento Topics seek to provide protection for its customers and itself when it comes to service resources. To do this, every account, cache, and topic has service limits, or what we call guardrails (like a curvy mountain road), to help keep operations running how they should and as smoothly as possible. This page outlines the default service limits:

| Momento Cache limits                  | Value    |
|---------------------------------------|----------|
| API Rate per cache (Data Plane)       | 100 requests/s |
| API Rate per customer (Control Plane) | 5 requests/s   |
| Throughput per cache                  | 1MB/s    |
| Maximum item size                     | 1MB      |
| Max Cache Count (per account)         | 10       |
| Time to Live (TTL)                    | 1 day    |

| Momento Topics limits                 | Value    |
|---------------------------------------|----------|
| Subscribers per topic                 | 100      |
| Message size                          | 100KiB per published message   |
| Throughput per topic                  | 100 publish requests/sec   |

As Momento Topics utilizes Momento Cache, all Cache limits apply to Topics as well.
