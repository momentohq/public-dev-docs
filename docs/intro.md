Momento Cache is the world's first truly serverless caching service. It provides instant elasticity, scale-to-zero capability, and blazing-fast performance. Gone are the days where you need to choose, manage, and provision capacity. With Momento Cache, you grab the SDK, you get an end point, input a few lines into your code, and you're off and running.

Momento Cache and [Momento Topics](./introduction/momento-topics.md) are available in the following cloud providers and Regions:

**AWS Regions**: us-west-2, us-east-1, eu-west-1, ap-south-1, ap-northeast-1

**GCP Regions**: us-central1, us-east4

If your prefered provider or Region are not listed, [contact us](mailto:support@momentohq.com) and let's talk.
